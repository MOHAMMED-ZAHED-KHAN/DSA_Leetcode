# My_DSA_Journey
This repository documents my personal journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) as a B.Tech 2nd-year student. It includes solutions to problems from platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and Coding Ninjas, written mainly in Java.  I'm using this space to build consistency, improve problem-solving skills.
